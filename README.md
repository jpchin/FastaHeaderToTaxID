# FastaHeaderToTaxID
Converts protein FASTA headers to NCBI taxon ID


INPUT: a FASTA file of *PROTEIN* sequences - this currently doesn't not work for DNA sequences
OUTPUT: and identical FASTA while where the headers have been entirely replaced with NCBI Taxon ID numbers for the organism which the protein is from.

CURRENT STATE:

Basic functionality, not that robust.
